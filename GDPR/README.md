# ISO/IEC 27001
- The **EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** requires organisations to adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures – including policies, procedures and processes – to protect the personal data they process.

- **ISO 27001**, the international standard for an ISMS (information security management system), provides an excellent starting point for achieving the technical and operational requirements necessary to reduce the risk of a breach.
## Cybersecurity Cube (McCumber)

A model framework for establishing and evaluating information security programs

1. Desired goals 
    - Confidentiality: unautharized access is prevented (cryptography, access lists)
    - Integrity: data should not be modified by unautharized users
    - Available: access should be accessible to authorized users when needed (9am-5pm, during working hours)

2. Data states
    - Storage: Data At Rest (DAR) in an information system e.g stored in  memory, a disk
    - Transmission: transferring data between information systems - also known as Data In Transit (DIT)
    - Processing: performing operations on data in order to achieve a desired objective
3. Safeguards
	- Human Factors: people should be aware of their roles - person in charge of setting up this firewall
	- Policies and Practices - configuration of the firewall, access control list
	- Technology - firewall
